So well, so now, you're here next to me
I want you so much
That it seems strange to me
So strange that it seems wrong to me

Seeing as how, seeing as how
You're only on the T.V
Ageless beauty with a sense of duty
On a film, on the T.V right now

Within sight, but out of reach
Oh, I wonder, oh, I wonder, oh, I wonder how?
How to make you, how to make you
How to make you see me too

Slow and easy with Virna Lisi, in a bed
Made for two
Walk the streets we're both so happy
Because the whole thing is so new

You're Virna Lisi, slow and easy
In a lifetime made for two
You've got blonde hair and blue and blue eyes
We're a strange pair under stranger skies

Be fair, be fair, don't be surprised
We're a strange pair under stranger skies
The image fickers, is something wrong?
This ain't nothing, it's only a song

So don't you worry, don't you hurry, just you turry
With me 'cos I'm so lone
And you, in a dress, in a dressing gown
Going up or going down

With a smile up here and one down there
Let me hold your hand, kiss your neck
Get loss in your hair
I'm lost in your hair, babe

Lisi, Virna Lisi
Lisi, Virna Lisi, oh

You've got blonde hair
The sky is falling, the sky is falling
Somebody catch it please

Slow and easy with Virna Lisi in a bed
Made for two
I ain't got time to catch the sky
I ain't got time for her and you
